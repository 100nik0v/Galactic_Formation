# Galactic_Formation
There is nothing here, I'll only add something when I fix the last problem.
In a nutshell this program is supposed to spawn 1000 random dots with different sizes and different velocoties.
Every second it redraws the screen with each dot having a new position that is calculated by the acceleration of gravity formula and their coordinates.
I have a few roadblocks in my way right now, I don't know how to program direction in java, dark matter is hard, its very hard to make stuff to scale, and black holes, stars and other celestial bodies.
